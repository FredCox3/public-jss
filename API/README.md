Examples of how we use the Casper JSS API in our workflows.

BASH - Where we started. Simple files, simple loops. Mash the data into the holes.

PHPcURL - This allows us to connect our home-grown inventory system to update the JSS auto-magically.

Python & PowerShell - As our needs grow, we needed more flexibility and power when dealing with XML. These treat xml as an object and allow
us greater flexibility in dynamically accessing the data.
